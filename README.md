KnowCal Backend

This is the backend code for KnowCal! It's a pretty typical REST API I made, and is equipped with a JWT tokening mechanisim for security. Like a lot of other REST APIs, there are lots of methods in controllers which are tied to routes, which are active in the server. The MySQL Schema can also be found in the code (ConciseDB.sql).
